# Basic Form Customisation

Now we have a [basic form created](./getting-started) then the next job is to add some steps and fields to our new form.

In the directory we just created we should now find a directory `./apps/my-hof-app`. This contains the configuration and code for our app.

Its contents should look something like this:

```
apps/my-hof-app/
├── fields/
├── translations/
└── index.js
```

## Adding Steps

Open the index.js file in a text editor. You will see a steps configuration that looks like this:

```js
steps: {
  '/name': {
    fields: ['name'],
    next: '/confirm'
  },
  '/confirm': {
    behaviours: ['complete', require('hof-behaviour-summary-page')],
    next: '/complete'
  },
  '/complete': {}
}
```

This defines the steps that our form takes, and the fields which are displayed on those steps.

The keys of the `steps` object define the urls for each step.

The basic configuration options you need to add a step can be seen on the `/name` step. The `fields` option defines which fields will be displayed, and the `next` option defines the step to which the user is taken when they complete the step.

To add a new step between `/name` and `/confirm` to collect a user's address we add a child object with a key of `/address` to the steps object.

Since it is going between `/name` and `/confirm` it should have a `next` property of `/confirm`, and we should modify the `next` property of the `/name` step to `/address`.

```js
steps: {
  '/name': {
    fields: ['name'],
    next: '/address'
  },
  '/address': {
    next: '/confirm'
    },
  '/confirm': {
  ...
```

Now if you restart your server and go back to your form in the browser you will see that when you complete the `/name` step you are taken to `/address`.

## Adding Fields

Now we need to add some fields to our new address step. This is as simple as adding the keys for those fields to the `fields` property of our new step object.

We'll add five fields to this step to collect a full address.

```js
steps: {
  ...
  '/address': {
    fields: ['address-line-1', 'address-line-2', 'town', 'country', 'postcode'],
    next: '/confirm'
  },
  ...
}
```

Returning to the app in a browser and refreshing (you will also need to restart your server each time you make changes, but we won't mention this from now on. There are [tools to help](https://npmjs.com/nodemon)) you will now see these fields on the address page.

### Configuring Fields

#### Validation Rules

The next job is to configure the validation rules for our new fields. The configuration for this can be found in `./fields/index.js` in our app directory.

You will see existing configuration for the `name` field that's already in our app. We can add new config objects for each of our new fields to this.

```js
module.exports = {
  name: {
    validate: 'required'
  },
  'address-line-1': {},
  'address-line-2': {},
  town: {},
  country: {},
  postcode: {}
};
```

We want to make all of the fields except `address-line-2` mandatory, and so can give them a `validate` property of `'required'`.

Additionally, we might want to do validation on the postcode to make sure it is correctly formatted, and so we can add an additional `postcode` validator. To add multiple validators to a field, simply set the validate property to an array.

```js
postcode: {
  validate: ['required', 'postcode']
}
```

#### Field Types

By default all fields are `input[type=text]` unless otherwise specified. In this case, we possibly want our country field to be a `select` element instead.

To do this we add a `mixin` property of `select` to that field.

```js
postcode: {
  mixin: 'select',
  validate: 'required'
}
```

We also need to add some options for the field. Fortunately there is a Home Office managed list of countries, so we don't need to handle this ourselves.

```js
postcode: {
  mixin: 'select',
  options: require('homeoffice-countries').allCountries,
  validate: 'required'
}
```

For more `mixin` options and field configuration settings see [hof-template-mixins](https://npmjs.com/hof-template-mixins).

## Customising Behaviour

You will also see in your configuration that the `/confirm` step has an additional `behaviours` option. This defines some custom functionality for that step.
